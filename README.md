This map shows a list of most popular Tokyo sightseeing places.
This map is built with ReactJS, Foursquare API and react-google-maps that utilizes Google Maps JavaScript API.

## How to get started:

Clone the repository:
`git clone https://github.com/gyermich/neighborhood-map.git`

Install and start with `npm`:

`npm install`

`npm start`

The service worker provided in the app lets the app load faster on subsequent visits in production, and gives it offline capabilities.
